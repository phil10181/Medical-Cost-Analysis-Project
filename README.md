# Medical-Cost-Analysis-Project
Overview: 
The Medical Cost Analysis Project explores the relationship between Medical Costs and Demographic Factors. The project was conducted in R to determine and analyze these relationships and determine trends.

Methods used in statistical analysis: 
1) Data cleaning: Checked for clean data by detecting and removing outliers and determining normality in the relationships between medical costs and each variable.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Constructed and analyzed visuals that display the relationships between medical costs and individual variables. 
3) Hypothesis testing: Applied appropriate hypothesis tests to further analyze findings from the EDA by assessing the significance of differences across means and medians of demographic variables.

Key Findings:
1) Gender: No significant differences in median healthcare costs across subgroups (male, female).
2) Regional: The initial differences in median medical costs across regions presented in the EDA were not statistically significant on further analysis. 
3) Smoking Status: Significantly higher mean healthcare costs for smokers compared to non-smokers.

Recommendations: Further exploration of anomalies in Gender and Region and expansion of the dataset. 

Conclusion: This project analyzes how demographic variables impact medical costs. I found that region and gender had a minimal impact on medical expenses while smoking status had a greater impact.
